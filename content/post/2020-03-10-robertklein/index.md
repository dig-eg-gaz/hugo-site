On Wednesday, September 4th, 1907, located on the third page under the column the Financial Advisor, the article explains how pedestrians are frustrated after the death of a native notable. The family opposed the exhumation of their body in order to establish who was responsible. Regulations, in accordance to the speed of drivers, were hoped to be enacted after this seemingly senseless death. People also hoped that drivers would be held responsible if future accidents, such as the one this section mentions, occurred. The article states that a majority of accidents from cars are caused from "furious" driving. This can be implied to mean that drivers were driving recklessly at the time, due to the minimal amount of driving regulations at the time of the accident. There were a considerable amount of complaints, and the author of the article mentions that they would not be surprised if pedestrians began to take measures into their own hands if laws were not enacted quickly and effectively.
