This individual research extends the essence of the group project in which the topic of economics and trade in Egypt. After the war with Britain, Egypt was turned to be a colony of Britain. Its economy had significant growth from the business introduced by the British. Businessman and the Egyptian colonial government promoted the civilization from the western industry to the locals. They strived to make the region as a European state. (1) To achieve that, many local resources such as arable lands and mineral pits were used for growing crops and mining. As more local industries started trading with other parts of the civilized world, the stock and exchange market formed. 

The newspaper Egyptian Gazette was the primary source for this analysis project. A company named Daira Senieh caught my attention. The classification of Daira Senieh was ambiguous. During the group project, some of my research partners found that the company was associated with the land. However, Daira Sneieh was also a sugar company that owns several agricultural plants and sugar cane fields in the company, was known for its sugar plantation in Upper Egypt and its massive freight transportation. Samir Raafat, a former banker, a columnist, wrote in his article that Daira Senieh owns 470 km of railroad lines, 65 locomotives, and 2,092 wagons. (2) Even in the time of this decade, the company’s scale is sizable. Additionally, the company was originated from Britain; it has a tie of the English royal family. There was a time when the company had a financial crisis. Egypt had a loss of its political sovereignty around the 1870s as the foreign rivalry entered. However, one study suspected that Egypt had sufficient resources and potential economic growth. Still, the reformed British government had mismanaged Egypt’s financial revenue, so the depression of the Egyptian companies started forming. (3) The companies like Daira Senieh had to either borrow loans from the World Bank or sell the company’s assets, such as lands. On the other hand, bad harvest and Russo-Turkish War aggravated the severity of Egypt’s financial situation. 

As I mentioned earlier, the company had relationships with the English royal family. At surface level, its land could be the company’s private property, but, in reality, it also could be seemed like the state’s territory/land. 

Since Daira Senieh had massive lands and properties, it attempted to bail out the company through auctions. As we know, the company had the Royal family ties, so the auction set by Daira Senieh was controversial because the properties of the company could also deem as the nation’s properties. Indeed, auctions on lands were ended with an failure. In one report published by The Brisbane Courier (4), an Australia newspaper, the sale of Daira Senieh had disapproval from the English and the French syndicate groups. The Egyptian government demanded to have one-third of share from the final sale price which hind the auction process. This is subsequent to the auction held in last 10 years, the company “a was unable to let a single acre of the sugar lands for 1888 in eight out of nine districts, and only 95 acres in the ninth district (the number offered to be let being about 25,000). (5)”

As Daira Senieh continued to privatize its agricultural properties, the value of the lands, which is diluted on the open market, increased tremendously (1). Therefore, the company’s consortium gained revenue, which is exceeded to their outstanding debts, so it paid off its debt of 4,444,340 Para in 1905, according to the World Bank documentation (6). 


Meanwhile, more foreign competitors acquired the lands from Daira Senieh to begin their industry in Egypt. 

In a glimpse of the economics of Egypt in the 1900s, I found Daira Senieh was founded during the invasion of Britain. However, it had some crisis in finance in 1886, perhaps due to the warfare. In the later decades, the company announced its bankruptcy and put its lands on sale. This incident was later known as Daira Senieh scandal. (7)

The scope of this research project is focused on the year of the newspaper I could access was between the year 1905 to the year 1908. I adopted the table of Stock and Share, which describe Egyptian companies’ value changes. With the regular expression, I use Xpath query to search the latest content repository, which was updated by the end of Fall 2019. With inserting `//div[@xml:id="deg-el-stsh01"]/table//cell[contains(.,'New Daira Sanieh Fond')]/preceding-sibling::cell/measure`, 126 results was found. I then organize the data with a trendline graph.
Nevertheless, the accuracy of the data obtained from Xpath 2.0 is plausible. This is mostly due to the incomplete updates in the .xml files for the tables of measures. Besides, some outliers in the graph below could be the typo during the process of digitizing the newspaper.

From the data, we can see the growth of Daira Senieh’s stock. It also coincides with the nation’s GDP growth since the company’s size shared a significant component of the Egyptian economy. This matched with the highlighted region of the real GDP graph showing below.
