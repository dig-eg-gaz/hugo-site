      <title>Gold Mining and the Gold Market:To What Extent does the Nile Valley Gold Company Reflect the Gold Market?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ran the XPath query: //div[@xml:id=&amp;quot;deg-el-reut01&amp;quot;]/table//cell[contains(.,&amp;#39;Nile Valley Gold Mine&amp;#39;)]/following-sibling::cell/measure. This search gave back 349 items, which were just the share prices, which ranged from 2 &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/24138582&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;According to David McMahon, who analyzed an Egyptian geological map, the gold was extracted mainly from the Wadi Hammamat region&lt;/a&gt;. This is a dry river bed around the Nile river, and was a major trading and mining route. The Nile Valley Gold mine was part of this trading route, and it was on the most direct path to the Red sea. This means that a lot of traffic went by these mines and trading posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data was extracted using regular expressions in the Atom text editor, and then put into an excel spreadsheet. In Tableau, I added a filter to exclude outlier values that were not accurate. I the proceeded to exclude the values that were in the templates (1.125, 1.25, 1). This made the visualization seem like a more accurate picture of what the actual data reflects. In almost all issues, The Nile Valley Gold company has &lt;em&gt;(New)&lt;/em&gt; next to it. This is because gold mining on a big scale was just beginning in Egypt.  &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://raregoldnuggets.com/?p=1850&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gold mining in the recent past has been on and off until 2009 when the Egyptian government gave out licenses to international partners to do the exploration in the eastern districts. For example, mining was done between 1902 and 1927 when it stopped until 1935 when it started again and then stopped in 1958.&amp;quot; &lt;/a&gt; This can explain the data I gathered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see what the Egyptian Gazette said about the gold market, so I ran a basic search of the repository for mentions of gold in a paragraph. I found an interesting article talking about the demand of gold domestically and abroad. In the third of January of 1905, it says:
                       &amp;quot;all countries which have debts held in large amounts abroad, the natives
                        begin to buy back those debts as soon as they advance in prosperity. Egypt,
                        apparently, is doing this now. In the second place, it relieves the London
                        market from one drain for gold. True, gold shipments after the turn of the
                        year will not cause as much inconvenience as they would have caused during
                        the past two or three months. Still it is well that the demand for the metal
                        from abroad should decline.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this, we can deduce that a lot of gold is being shipped abroad. This is because of debts owed to other countries. However, the extent to which the demand for gold decreased is unknown. A conclusion cannot be drawn from the price of the gold stocks, as there are many factors that play into the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_15762724613630/Sheet2?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visualized data, interestingly, shows a downward trend, as the value of gold goes from 2.625 in January of 1905 to .25 in August of the same year. The price doesn&amp;#39;t seem to recover. This could be due to many things. However, I believe that people were optimistic about the company at first, but then the company did not do well. New companies tend to carry a lot of risk, and have the possibility of failing. I wanted to know if the company did end up failing, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spink.com/lot/17016000072&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;found a certificate of a share of the company at an auction.&lt;/a&gt; This certificate indicates that the share was selling for Â£1, indicating that the price did end up stabilizing somewhat. However, I can find no mention of the company beyond 1912. This suggests that either the other mining companies were more prominent and important, or that the company did not succeed as other companies were already mining the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that there is European presence in Egypt in the early Twentieth century. This is seen in advertisements, articles, and even the stocks and shares list. The Nile Valley Gold mine was run, presumably, by the British. It is, after all, valuated in Euros. A lot of mines were opened in the wake of the 1900s. &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.openedition.org/cdf/5241?lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Their openings date from the early twentieth century at a time when the Eastern Desert experienced renewed interest and when British mining companies explored the ancient sites&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; During this time there was also a growing interest on Ancient Egyptian history, and historians found various tombs decorated with gold. This, along with the large deposits of gold along the Nile river, led to great innovations in the gold mining sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Nile Valley Gold company is but one company and does not give a clear indication of the gold market in Egypt. However, it does give insight on the popular trading spots, and how large scale gold mining became popular in Egypt around this time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Sultan&#39;s Kidney Disease</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-12-13-jimmymendez/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the month of September issues of the Egyptian Gazette, the newspaper talks about the Sultan&amp;#39;s illness. Specifically, in page three of the September 21st issue of 1906, the Sultan is mentioned and the author says he has Bright&amp;#39;s disease. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright%27s_disease&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;This disease was named after Richard Bright, a physician.&lt;/a&gt; It was a disease pertaining to the kidney, but was later discovered to be a classification of a variety of kidney diseases that were unknown at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;kidney.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Brights-Disease&#34; title=&#34;A kidney with Bright&#39;s Disease&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A patient with this disease could experience swelling, convulsions, blindness, and coma. A lot of patients with this disease may have also had high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes. The newspaper mentions Dr. Nafiz, and Dr. Noureddin Pasha as the primary physicians of the Sultan, but it mentions that they had to consult Professor Bergmann for assistance. Bergmann was the one to diagnose the Sultan with Bright&amp;#39;s disease, and ordered an immediate surgical operation. He also says that he is suffering from &amp;quot;other complications,&amp;quot; which may be anything from diabetes to heart disease to kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160915235645/https:/www.guideline.gov/summaries/summary/36900&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Today, a patient with the same symptoms would be likely diagnosed with chronic nephritis, which is an inflammation of the kidney.&lt;/a&gt; However, in the Thursday issue, it is mentioned that the Sultan was suffering from a stone. This means that he may have had a urinary tract infection. The most common cause of a UTI is  Escherichia coli, or similar fungi. Other causes may include genetic predisposition or being uncircumcised. What exactly caused the Sultan to be ill is unknown, however, the diagnosis at the time was based on similar cases. Richard Bright attributed the disease to high blood pressure and diabetes, which could have been true in the Sultan&amp;#39;s case, as he mourned the recent death of two high functionaries, one of which &amp;quot;enjoyed his majesty&amp;#39;s confidence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Economic History of Stocks and Shares</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-stocks/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;identifying-data-sets-bailee&#34;&gt;Identifying Data Sets: Bailee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group was primarily focused on the section of the Egyptian Gazette called Stocks and Shares, a table listing various companies and the prices of their respective shares. The companies are divided into various sections such as âbanks,â âland,â âcommercial/industrial,â ânavigation &amp;amp; water works,â and ârailways and tramways.â To select specific companies to analyze within each industry, I looked for one or two companies whose shares were listed in pounds (for ease of comparison- though it would be possible to convert from one type of currency to another, it was simpler this way), then picked the companies with the highest share prices. Choosing one or two companies with the highest share prices seemed like one possible way to find companies who were dominating those industries and could therefore provide an accurate assessment of Alexandriaâs economy during a specific time period. The following eight companies were selected from those criteria: Imperial Ottoman Bank, National Bank of Egypt, New Daira Sanieh Fond., Alexandria Bonded Stores Pref., pref. Cairo Sewage Transport Ord., Alex. Water Company, Cairo-Helouan, and Keneh-Assouan. (For clarity, these names were lifted directly from the tables in question.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-the-datasource-alvin&#34;&gt;Introducing the Datasource: Alvin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the selection of the eight companies above, we found that those companies can be distinguished into two categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them is finance, which includes Imperial Ottoman Bank, National Bank of Egypt, New Daira Sanieh Found, Alexandria Bounded Stores Pref, and Keneh-Assouan (Assurance). It is apparent that bank, insurance, and estate companies are likely to have more influence on the stock market, so we choose to observe them from a micro-scale, and then link them to the macroeconomics of Egypt. For instance, &lt;a href=&#34;http://psi424.cankaya.edu.tr/uploads/files/Pamuk,%20Evolution%20of%20Financial%20Institutions,%201600-1914%20(2004).PDF&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ottoman Bank&lt;/a&gt; helped foreign interest groups to have their investments in Egypt. Its shares consisted of thousands of English Group and French Group. It also functioned as a loan provider by issuing loans to the government of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that the investors and businessmen in Egypt needed to borrow loans to develop and establish their industries to the emerging economics boom at the start of the 1900s. In return, the consumers and investors built up their credits and deposited their revenues to the bank, which allows the bank to have more power to promote regional development. As the economy boomed, the values of land prices increased. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.egy.com/historica/97-07-00.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Daira Sanieh&lt;/a&gt;  was a sugar company, and it also held many lands in North Egypt. During the booming, its lands were brought by several foreign investors. It used to have about 4 million Para (Ottoman Turkish currency) debt. After the sale of lands, its debt was paid off. On the sides of that, insurance companies had roles in decreasing the risk of the investors in the financial system and preventing the cost when companies have defaulted or failed to obligate the promise of paying back loans. Meanwhile, insurance companies hold &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272305139_Egyptian_Insurance_Market_History_and_Structure&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;large shares&lt;/a&gt; from other companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second category is the infrastructure. In this project, we include Cairo Sewage Transport., Alexandria Water Company, and Cairo Helouan. In two decades, from 1880 to 1900, the population of Egypt had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri01chisrich#page/568/mode/2up&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;exponential growth&lt;/a&gt;. The population in Alexandria grew half the amount of what it had in 1882. In 1907, it had 332,246 in Cairo. With the growth of population, more water installments and more transportation were needed to support the citiesâ operation. The water was primarily relied on Suez and Niles. In major cities like Cairo and Alexandria, they had many railroads and tram companies serving for passengers and freight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-of-obtaining-preliminary-values-pre-correction-bailee&#34;&gt;Process of Obtaining Preliminary Values Pre-Correction: Bailee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to collect values from these companies, I ran the following XPath query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;//div[@xml:id=âdeg-el-stsh01â]/table//cell[contains(.,âImperial Ottoman Bankâ)]/preceding-sibling::cell/measure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular query would deliver the share price (in pounds) for the Imperial Ottoman Bank in each properly labeled Stocks and Shares table within the content repository. (For reference, I updated my version of the content repository on November 13, 2019 at approximately 11 am.) I then took the search results and used Atom to isolate only the dates and share prices, then pasted them as separate columns in an Excel document.
To obtain values from the other companies, I simply replaced the blue text with another companyâs name and followed the same process. In this way, the XPath query for, say, Cairo Sewage Transport Ord. would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;//div[@xml:id=&amp;ldquo;deg-el-stsh01&amp;rdquo;]/table//cell[contains(.,&amp;lsquo;pref. Cairo Sewage Transport Ord.&amp;rsquo;)]/preceding-sibling::cell/measure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running the query &lt;strong&gt;//div[@xml:id=âdeg-el-stsh01â]&lt;/strong&gt; showed 175 ocurrences of the Stocks and Shares table within the content repository. However, we had to determine whether the data shown was correct or if it was simply the templated information. So, we decided to restrict to a smaller sample size of data that we could plausibly correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period of time that we chose was the year 1905, as the XPath query I ran seemed to show that editions from 1905 had the most complete data sets (perhaps because IDS classes are working on this newspaper in chronological order). Of all the companies listed, Alexandria Bonded Stores Pref., a commercial/industrial company, had the most results in 1905 (94 results). However, 94 tables would be too many for us to check (plausibly). So, we decided to use data only from Wednesdays as a sample. In order to isolate data from Wednesday editions, I imported values corresponding to Alexandria Bonded Stores Pref. in 1905 to Tableau. I set âweekdaysâ of dates as columns and âcountâ of the values to find how many of the values came from which day of the week. The largest number of values for Alexandria Bonded Stores Pref. (18 values) were present in Wednesday editions. Tableau confuses me still, so I just used a calendar from 1905 to find out which dates were Wednesdays after figuring out that Wednesdays held the largest data pool. After further research, we found that Wednesdayâs stocks and shares data would experience the &lt;a href=&#34;https://finance.zacks.com/day-week-volatile-stock-market-3009.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;least volatility&lt;/a&gt; given its placement exactly between market open and market close in the available trading days throughout any given week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-short-aside-on-correction-austin&#34;&gt;A Short Aside on Correction: Austin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dates that I was supposed to research based on our query were the following: &lt;strong&gt;3/8/1905&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The first thing to note was that the query was pretty accurate, albeit it still had some problems. Problems not on our end, but flawed issues based on the fact that our repository that we were basing our working sets on were made by other students/people. For the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; chart, I had to figure out why the xml work was showing it was on page six but the image didnât include it. I had to look through the other pages and found out that it didnât exist for the date. For the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; table, it was correct but just on a different page than where it was on the source file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-visualization-process-jimmy&#34;&gt;The Visualization Process: Jimmy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the excel document Bailee made, I opened a Tableau document and imported the data. I first had to include filters because a lot of the data was from the template. The data still may have not been accurate, so as a group we decided to use a sample and manually change the data. Because of the small data sample, the graphs of the stocks look more rigid and a lot donât move over the course of the year. However, there are interesting jumps here and there in the data. Also, I decided to use the excel visualization platform for the final graphs because it is more intuitive for me. These visualizations include companies in different industries, such as banks, land, commercial industrial, navigation and waterworks, and railways. The National Bank of Egypt seems to have the most dynamic movement, while the Imperial Ottoman Bank hardly moves at all. There seems to be a jump in the prices of bank stocks in January of 1906. However, at the same time the Daira Sanieh stock seems to drop and so does the Alexandria Water company. Whether or not it is in any way correlated remains unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;banks&#34;&gt;Banks:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Imperial-Ottoman-Bank.png&#34; alt=&#34;Imperial-Ottoman-Bank&#34; title=&#34;graphs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigation-waterworks&#34;&gt;Navigation &amp;amp; Waterworks:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Alex-Water-Company.png&#34; alt=&#34;Alex.-Water-Company&#34; title=&#34;graphs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;railways-and-tramways&#34;&gt;Railways and Tramways:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Cairo-Helouan.png&#34; alt=&#34;Cairo-Helouan&#34; title=&#34;graphs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Keneh-Assouan.png&#34; alt=&#34;Keneh-Assouan&#34; title=&#34;graphs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-austin&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Austin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the dates are such a small sample size, the difference in share prices were minuscule so I decided to focus more solely on a very important stock at the time and even now for the country of Egypt. During the early 1900âs, Egypt was going through an economic crisis and were in the middle of rebuilding their economy as the British had taken over after the war in 1882. The British made it their goal to pool resources into Egypts economy and this is why the National Bank of Egypt, the oldest and biggest bank in Egypt was able to recover and even have steady stock growth all throughout 1905 and into 1906. Another thing to note is that the tables show debentures and the National Bank of Egypt did not issue any throughout 1905 and this can indicate that the bank was a secure investment and backed by reliable assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final point of this project was to see how the financial markets were doing and using this as an evaluation of how the economy in Egypt was during the time period of 1905. The main reason we as a group were trying to find the answer to this question is because Egypt was suffering from a declining economy and after the war of 1882, where the British took over, they made rebuilding Egyptâs economy a priority. The latter reason is that Egypt went through a major recession in the year of 1907 and on, and we wanted to see how stabilized the markets were prior. As we can see from our charts, many of the top performing stocks were either on a clear uptrend or were stabilized around a certain price, indicating that Egyptâs economy was quite strong during 1905.&lt;/p&gt;
