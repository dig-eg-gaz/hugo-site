      <title>Horse Racing in 1907</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Horse-racing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Horse racing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horse racing in Egypt during the early 1900s appeared to be an interesting sport of study to me. It included my interest in sports that I shared with the rest of my group. As for the reason why I specifically chose this, it was because I reasoned that horse back racing must have been quite popular during those times which would make for an equally enjoyable and manageable form of study. While looking through the text, it is evident that they do not officially play sports like we do here in the U.S. today. For instance, they do not take many things into consideration, such as variable handicaps as well as the weights of the actual people riding the horse. This is rather quite important considering a horse is not a car. Why these matter is because even in professional race car drivers, just being a leaner individual allows your car to effectively lose drag. This is somewhat negligible in say a street race but is practically essential in races that use very accurate and miniscule readings such as milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To relate this back to the topic at hand, the race time tracking that take place in Egypt at that time are vastly inferior. This leads me to believe that they either have an understandable technological disadvantage or that they treat this as a mostly recreational/ semi professional event. I could possibly conclude, however, that it is a recreational event simply when looking at the time intervals between each race. The races all take place within roughly 30 minutes of each other. This does not allow any time for proper cleaning, shoveling of road, or any other professional changes done to ensure that it stays consistent through each race. Curiously enough, the audience also does not seem to value variety. This is seen when looking at how formulaic the text in the newspaper is. It follows the same pattern each race and even includes the same words about how, “Arab ponies have never won a race of any value.” This stagnation is even seen in the types of horses they use. Consistently as they put it, the Arab horses do not win, by quite a significant margin. In fact, most times it is the Galloway horses that triumph as they are the pure-bred ones. With these in mind, it does not seem as though they are trying to attract newer audiences or even change anything as the formula persists throughout months and years. Instead, it seems to have a following that much like its formula seems to remain largely unchanged as time goes by. Which leads me to the first weakness of this topic.
As with anything that pertains to history, there is an innate issue with accuracy here. It is hard to determine whether this formula was made on purpose and is made that way for ease of reading throughout the multiple issues that this takes place, or if instead the writers simply did not want to creatively document it differently from issue to issue. Regardless of the reason, this makes it hard for a student to gather up his data simply due to the unusualness in how this data is presented. Likewise, prize pools can be systematically repeated throughout races as well. This adds another formulaic variable that makes this sport seem rather dull on the surface. In this sense, if a student were to look at this only through what is written on the newspaper, the sport would not look interesting enough to warrant even a second reading from a different issue and would beg the question why someone would not just guess their own results. Especially when there is quite frankly an 100% certainty that indeed the Arab pony will not win the day.
With this being said, there are still some differences between the races. Such as the names of the races themselves. Though they follow the same standard naming schemes of “plates”, they still do have different types of plates depending on the months/seasons they are raced in. Likewise, the prize pool variates in correspondence with the plate names.
When looking at the May 1905 races we see that there is a lot more at stake here. It practically dwarfs the others in terms of monetary value in the first and second place prize earnings. Likewise, it seems that in July 1905 there was a very significant drop-off in the prize earnings. It went from about 60k to just under 10k. This may be due to a reduction in the prize earnings due to popularity or simply could be because of less overall races. Luckily I have this data and interestingly enough, they both have the same races. It is 6 for both, meaning July was really just a year that awarded a lot less money for first place This is consistent even when compared with other dates. However, Monday is still an anomaly since it greatly exceeds any other prize offerings from the other months. The months of March 1906, October 1906, and July 1907 are what I would consider to be very average months. They have nothing special between any of them in terms of prize pools for both first and second place. This leads me to believe that May 1905, October 1905,  and February 1907 are the strange ones in terms of the prize earnings. This is not too surprising however, since it did not seem like quite a popular sport as it was mostly amateurish and very formulaic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Musical Performance</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-12-13-karl-frederickroche/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to investigate the music side of the Egyptian Gazette. This is because I found it rather interesting and wanted to see how the people as well as the newspaper itself reacts to musical literature. To my surprise I found that they are much more candid than I would have otherwise expected. When looking at my Monday issue I found an article on a fifth annual musical entertainment scene. They described the pupils there as well as gave the readers insight into some of their hardships as well as how they improved from last year’s performance. Due to this, I can also safely assume that this must be something that regularly occurs since this is the fifth time they have had such an entertainment. As stated, the writer is very candid and explains the downfalls and concerns they had over the performance. For example, the chorus sounded too forced and containing a lack of vibrancy. However, the writer did not only explain shortcomings. He also gave ample credit when he felt it necessary. This happened during a duet for the soprano and tenor which he labeled as “pleasant”, along with a violin solo which he said was given in a manner that was “most commendable”.  It was also stated that this chorus came from Macbeth, which gives me insight into what the Egyptian audience liked to listen to at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading this article, I remember &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-pierre/&#34;&gt;the blog post&lt;/a&gt; that I read before this. It is similar to this one, however, it looked at the individual artists and the culture rather than the performance as a whole. Nonetheless, it provided me with very helpful information, such as how the Egyptian musical culture is different from our own. He also found it interesting to see how the writers explain events such as what I noted with how candid they were. It does indeed make someone wonder if that is how the audience felt. Though this will most likely be a question that can’t be answered simply because we cannot go back to that exact time and see for ourselves. Until then, this is all we have to go off of and we must take it as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Brings in the Crowds for Sporting Events?</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-sports/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, sports have impacted the lives of not only the participants, but also the fans who choose to watch them. As the sports group, we decided to focus our analysis project on the different factors which can affect spectator turnout across the major sports of the Egyptian Gazette. Among residents of early 1900’s Egypt, three of the most popular sports were football (soccer), polo, and horse racing. By looking into the data that we have collected for these sports, we are able to get an idea of what Egyptian sport fans wanted to see. Through our analysis of the Egyptian Gazette data and cross-checking with multiple studies on attendance of various sports, we have concluded that in early 1900’s Egypt, there were three major factors of sports attendance: level of competition/skill of either side, rivalry between the two sides, and importance/stakes of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of how to get fans in attendance of sporting events is nothing new; as long as there have been sports, there have been those in charge trying to increase attendance. Especially recently, sporting events provide a large stream of revenue, so factors which influence attendance are important information for those involved in sports. Experts and researchers, such as John Douvis and Peter Bird, have tried finding these factors in many different ways across a wide range of sports. These publications are looking at current factors, of which many do not apply to early 1900’s Egypt, however common themes across generations have held true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to collect this data, we ran a series of XPath queries aimed at finding as many games as possible for each sport. We searched for the “sport and play” sections of the newspaper, where sports data and stats are most often found. One problem we came across was that many of the sport and play sections were not tagged with the sport feature type. To combat this, we removed //div[@feature=”sport”] from our queries and replaced it with //head[matches(.,’sport and play’, ‘i’)]. What this did was return to us any div with the header “Sport and Play,” which only included sport and play sections. We utilized this along with searching for sport-specific terms like “chukker” (polo) to collect the full data range that was available to us. We also realized that many sections use qualitative descriptions instead of numbers for attendance data. These sections often used the same terms, such as “fine,” “large,” and “very large,” so we recorded these descriptions anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;football&#34;&gt;Football&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Football was one of the most popular sports at the time, often played between different military regiments or schools. The military teams, such as the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, were split into teams or “companies,” although they did sometimes compete together. This brings us to our first factor of attendance, level of competition.
&lt;img src=&#34;soccer2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Football&#34; title=&#34;Attendance of each football game&#34;&gt;
When looking at the attendance data for these games, the effect of this factor becomes clear. The matches with high attendance are all between two of the military unit teams at full strength, and not divided into companies. Matches between two of the subdivided units, such as the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers F. and D. Companies, tended to have much less attendance than the more high-profile competitions. This, of course, is logical because more fans are going to be willing to attend a game if it is between two good teams. The research of Peter J. W. N. Bird on league football attendance also supports this factor. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www-jstor-org.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/stable/2348449?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents&#34;&gt;“The Demand for League Football,”&lt;/a&gt; Bird looks at various teams and determined that whether or not the team was a contender during the season or a contender for the play-offs was a highly significant factor with a strong positive relation to attendance. Continuing with this first factor, the skill level of the away team appears to also play a role.
&lt;img src=&#34;soccer3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Football2&#34; title=&#34;Football attendance vs margin of victory&#34;&gt;
The data above shows that there was significantly higher attendance in games where the away team had a bigger the margin of victory (shown by the points below 0). This correlation is strikingly direct, and displays an positive relationship between attendance and away team performance. This suggests a number of things, but we concluded the reason for this trend is that when a good team is in town, fans in the area would be likely to attend the game. Often, teams would have large gaps between games at the same away location, so fans understood that each of these games was the last time they could see the team for a while.  This is supported by Hal Hansen and Roger Gauthier, who in 1989 researched and collected &lt;a href=&#34;http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;amp;P=AN&amp;amp;K=16462549&amp;amp;S=R&amp;amp;D=s3h&amp;amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40Sep644wtvhOLCmr1Gep7dSsKa4TbSWxWXS&amp;amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGrsUi2pq5MuePfgeyx43zx&#34;&gt;40 different factors&lt;/a&gt; which impact attendance. Included in these are the record of the visiting team and the number of star athletes on the visiting team. Like it does for the home team, the skill level of the away team makes people more inclined to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;polo&#34;&gt;Polo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest team sports in history, polo was also very popular in early 1900’s Egypt. Like football, polo was often played by military regiments, but polo also included more organized teams. Because there was more parity between teams, attendance is more uniform across games than football.
&lt;img src=&#34;polo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Polo&#34; title=&#34;Attendance of polo games&#34;&gt;
Polo attendance in the Egyptian Gazette was only recorded as “fair,” “large,” or “very large,” so we decided to display these terms numerically 1-3 for our data visualization. Our second attendance factor, rivalry or repeated matchups, applies to our polo data. Teams like the 60th Rifles, the Mosquitos, the Egyptian Army, and the Tourists played each other more often than other teams did, and thus drew significantly bigger audiences for their games. This factor is corroborated by Hansen and Gauthier, who have “Rivalry between competing home team and opponent” as a significant factor. G.V. Wall, a researcher who analyzed attendance of Toronto Blue Jays’ games, also determined that rivalry is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://sparti.uop.gr/~toda/asmrj/Vol1_c.pdf&#34;&gt;“especially prominent indicator of attendance.”&lt;/a&gt; As teams play each other more, the competitiveness of the matchup rises, and fans are more interested in the result. Along with this, these teams played more games in general, meaning fans were more familiar with them and more likely to attend a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;horse-racing&#34;&gt;Horse Racing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sport of the Egyptian Gazette that we are analyzing is horse racing. The data we found for horse racing was unique to that of our other sports because of the different stats and measurements that are recorded for it. First of all, these races all had different stakes and payouts for 1st-3rd place. Helouan was very popular venue for these horse races, but most of these races tended to be lower stakes, more recreational competitions. Instead, we are focusing on the derbies or “plates” with higher stakes. Along with the increased competition, spectators were drawn to these races because of the money on the line. Some of these plates had first place prizes upwards of 25,000 Egyptian pounds, which naturally generated more interest from fans.
&lt;img src=&#34;horse.png&#34; alt=&#34;HorseRacing&#34; title=&#34;Stakes for each race&#39;s top 3 finishers&#34;&gt;
We call this factor the importance factor, because spectators are generally more interested in competitions that are more important and have more on the line, whether it be prize money or a championship trophy. This factor is why, for example, NBA Finals games are more watched than regular season competitions. The importance factor stems from a combination of multiple other factors, as many things go into how “important” a competition is. In the case of horse racing in the Egyptian Gazette, this importance comes from the large sums of money available to the winners. Unsurprisingly, the plates highest in prize amounts are the plates which were most popular and anticipated. The Sahara Stakes is especially significant, boasting a 33,000 first place prize, and a second-place prize double that of any other race we found. These plates are among the most popular of any sporting event in the Egyptian Gazette because of their high stakes and intensity. The importance factor is also seen in the sport of billiards. Despite its popularity, the data found for billiards in the newspaper is rather sparse. However, we can see that the attendance in the match referred to as the “final match” was described as “smoking” and “a concert,” as opposed to others which just state that attendance was “few.” Overall, the factor of importance describes how much the average fan cares about the result of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across any sport, there are common factors which influence spectator turnout. The level of competition, or the skills of either team, is our first attendance factor. Fans would rather watch competition between two good teams than two poor ones, so games with better participants competing will draw more of a crowd. Specifically, in the case of football, the skill of the away team also impacts attendance, as more fans will go to a game if the visiting team is especially good. Rivalries are also a significant factor in attendance, because as two teams continue to play each other, the intensity and emotions of the matchup increase with each game. Finally, fans have more interest in important games with higher stakes and more on the line. When the competition has a large prize, like in horse racing, or is a championship, like in billiards, people have more interest in the outcome of the game and are more likely to choose to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
