&lt;p&gt;The Russian Revolution of 1905 began with Tsar Nicholas II attempting to transform the Russian government from an autocracy to a monarchy (Smith). His attempt for a new system of government led to political and social unrest across the Russian Empire. Although this movement originally began many years before 1905, the &amp;ldquo;Bloody Sunday&amp;rdquo; massacre on the 22nd of January of that year is known to have sparked this revolution (Shimazu). When a bunch of workers, specially the poor, took on the streets and made their way to Tsar&amp;rsquo;s Palace in hopes of presenting a petition for better working conditions, they were welcomed with gunfire. Worker strikes, urban uprisings, and peasant revolts continued over the next several years (Heywood).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is all just basic research that anyone can learn about using the internet. However, I wanted to go on further into this topic as it caught my attention while I was reading the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; newspaper. Before hand, I had no clue about this event in history. Being in the class of Microhistory, I have been given the opportunity to access the archives, or newspaper articles, of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. With this source, I was able to look into fresh insights of the roles individuals, social groups, and political parties played throughout the Russian Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;1905-01-23-p3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image label&#34; title=&#34;OPEN REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA: People&#39;s appeal to the Tsar. Conflicts with troops. Thousands killed!&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I did my search query, I wanted to see what this newspaper had to say about the &amp;ldquo;Bloody Sunday&amp;rdquo; massacre. Therefore, I looked through the content folder for January 22nd of 1905 but no luck. However the following day, January 23rd, the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was full with information regarding this terrible event. According to the newspaper, it all began around 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock when huge crowds marched to the Winter Palace to present a petition to Tsar. The petition said, “Satisfy these demands and you make Russia happy and glorious. If you do not reply to the people&amp;rsquo;s prayer, we prefer to die in the Square before your Palace&amp;rdquo;, and sadly that&amp;rsquo;s what happened. Soon, the crowd started to run away and rapidly barricaded themselves across the city. Reading insights like, &amp;ldquo;troops were firing recklessly&amp;hellip; The air is rent with cries of women and the angry shouts of men&amp;rdquo;, heavily portrays a tense mood. This day, full with unpleasant and dreadful memories for many, has come to be known as the &amp;ldquo;Bloody Sunday&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why, why and how did all of this start? What were the reasons that led to the Revolution in Russia? Looking through relevant posts I was able to find the factors that played a major role in this, other than the Bloody Sunday. Anthony Muniz argues in his &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-muniz/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that they are four main factors. Things such as huge gaps between social classes, poor economy, land ownership laws, and &amp;ldquo;anger amongst the educated class&amp;rdquo;. Although I agree with Muniz, all of these problems wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have occurred if the Russo-Japanese War didn&amp;rsquo;t happen several years before. The citizens of Russia rose in revolutionary groups as they saw Tsar Nicholas II as a weak leader. Civilians didn&amp;rsquo;t just simply surrender. They immediately rebeled against Tsar&amp;rsquo;s inhuman actions in a fight that would go on throughout the next 3 years. The question is, will Nicholas II&amp;rsquo;s actions to preserve his autocracy have serious consequences or will his power over the military suppress any opposition? Jonathan Cannon was able to answer this in his &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-cannon/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;if the Tsar keeps the support of the army he can maintain power&amp;rdquo;. Conversely, his power over the military declined as soldiers began to support and fight alongside the rebels. Even so, in the end, the Russian government &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rdquo; as the Tsar remained absolute leader. While this may be true, peace only came about when promises were made to the citizens of a &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rsquo;s government&amp;rdquo; with amendments to come and a new Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
