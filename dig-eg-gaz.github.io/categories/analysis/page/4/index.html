      <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-hernandez/" >Maximum and Minimum Temperature in Alexandria, Egypt (May 1906-April 1907)</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Introduction Over the last few decades, the topic of global warming has gotten huge publicity all around the world. This analysis was created with the purpose of finding out whether or not global warming has been occuring specifically in Alexandria, Egypt by taking data found from May 1906 to April 1907 and comparing it to an article I found that lists the temperature change in Alexandria Egypt over the last 100 years to see if there has been an increase in the average temeperature and if so what could be the leading factors in the climate change.

      <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-house/" >The Geography of Accidents</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          For my analysis project, I wanted to find data on where accidents occurred that were covered by the Egyptian Gazette. To do this, I started with the Xpath query //div[contains(., &quot;ACCIDENT&quot;)]//placeName to find articles containing the word accident and a place name tag. This produced 279 results. To see which of these were classified as international, I used the query //div[@feature=wire][contains(., &quot;ACCIDENT&quot;)]//placeName to search only in the Wire/Telegram section. This produced only 51 results, which were interestingly entirely in Europe and North America, with the one exception of a story from Jaffa, in Israel.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-arenas/" >Attitudes towards Germany: Random, Situational, or Seasonal?</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          1905 was a watershed year in the period preceding WWI. Tensions ran high as Russia was in the process of earning the distinct honor of being the first European nation to lose a war to a non-Western power (Japan), and the great powers were concerned if this, and the nascent but ultimately futile 1905 revolution, meant the decline of Russia as a major imperial power, which would certainly throw the delicate balance of alliances into chaos.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-porter/" >Golf in Egypt in the early 20th century</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Golf in today’s day in age has come a long way since it was invented in the 19th century. The technology, how it is played, taught and how it is treated at country clubs. There were country clubs that had golf courses in the beginning of the 20th century around the word but the clubs didn’t usually revolve around the golf courses rather than the typical “sporting” club games such as croquet and other games played on nice grass surfaces.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-pustam/" >Wedding Fashion Trends 1905-1906</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Acquiring data for this project was tough. My data was qualitative, not quantitative, so I couldn’t just find charts with what I needed and call it a day. Initially, I wanted to look at fashion trends and how they evolved within the 2 year period. However, as mentioned before, finding the data was difficult. Whenever I looked up ‘fashion’, it would refer me to a hotel ad. Back then, they used different terms to describe fashion.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-beasley/" >Temperatures in Assouan and Port Said</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          In this analysis project I analyzed the temperatures of Port Said and Assouan. Specifically, I gathered information about the maximum temperatures and the minimum temperatures. This data was pulled from the section titled ‘Daily Weather Report’ from within the Egyptian Gazette newspaper. The section appears in almost every days’ issue and includes information such as the highs and lows in the shade, the humidity percentages, and the rainfall totals of all the major cities within Egypt during the early twentieth century.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-northcutt/" >Anti-Semitism in Egypt and Surrounding Countries</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          When first reading the Egyptian Gazette, one can see how many times death is mentioned. This can be easily understood; as humans have been interested in death for centuries. However, I wanted to delve deeper into the kinds of deaths that were mentioned in the newspaper. Unfortunately, I came across a telegram that talked about a Jewish person’s death because of Anti-Semitic reasons. Because of this, I was moved to look into the Jewish condition in Egypt, as it is a relevant topic today and it had not been looked into my another classmate.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-richardson/" >Children in Alexandria</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Analysis topic The Egyptian Gazette is filled with information from accidents to steamship schedules. Over the course of this course of this class I have read countless articles on Lord Cromer and the Plague, but there has been little mention of children in Alexandria. With the help of Mr. Hanley I choose to further look into an area of history that this class has not studied. There is little known about children in Alexandria during the early 1900's.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-ebert/" >Egyptian Export Companies</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          My analysis project focuses on two companies that ship goods from Egypt to England. They are Carver Bros Company and Behrend Company. I will compare and contrast the goods that each company exports as well as their levels of success. I am analyzing data from the full content available to me from the Egyptian Gazette, meaning these results range from January 1905 through July 1907. I will also use them to exemplify the Egyptian export industry based off of research I have collected.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-meyer/" >Fires</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          With Egypt being located along the Mediterranean Coast, most of their months in the summer is hot and dry in the majority of the country, and humid in the Delta. When temperatures become so high, it can be extremely easy to ignite or cause a fire by heat from the sun. The topic that I am going to analyze for this paper is the fires that appear in Alexandria, Egypt and that are accounted for and the amount of fatalities marked in each.
