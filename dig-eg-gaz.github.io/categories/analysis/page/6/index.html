      <div class="article-style">
        
          When we think of the day to day lives of people we may think of a consistent schedule that only changes when major events happen. However, from first hand experience I know the largest disruption to daily life are accidents. So when looking at the lives of people living halfway across the world over a hundred years ago I wanted to see how they handled these accidents and in what ways they were affected by them.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          Theft should be considered one of the most selfish crimes, as it is literally the act of stealing from others in order to benefit from their belongings. Whether it is out of desperation, or simply for the rush of adrenaline, robbery should not be a crime that is as common as it is today. However, robbery has not only been an issue recently; as shown in multiple issues of The Egyptian Gazette from 1905 to 1906.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          Expanding on my blog post “Is Egypt In a Bubble?,” I dug through the pages of the Egyptian Gazette and traced the “Stocks and Shares” table throughout 1905 and 1906 with as much data available from 1907 as well.
This table listed the stock with its stock price as well as its debenture price. A stock is a portion of company ownership that is sold to the public for which the owner of the stock receives a part of said company’s earnings.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          The Egyptian Gazette was a well-rounded newspaper containing topics varying from weather, plague, sports, and daily trade. There are so many topics covered, it was Egypt’s source of news in the early 20th century. While going through the newspaper, coding it, and reading the different stories, something stuck out to me. I was coding page four of my Monday issue when I read about a show within a small theatre in Egypt.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          I will explore the Egyptian education system in the early 1900s. This project will include the locations of schools that make headlines in the news, including the schools that are being advertised. This will also include what months of the year education seems to be of most importance in the newspaper. I will also look for trends in the school system, such as common problems (Sailer, 1912) or modernization (Saleh, 2012).

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-fitzpatrick/" >The fascination with death</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Humans have a natural sense of curiosity about them, and this curiosity can be innocent such as the fascination with a person they’ll never meet and instead reading stories about them, but it can also be darker and the focus can be on murder and torture. The source of our curiosity stems from a trait of human species call neoteny, according to Tom Stafford of BBC. This trait means that we as a species are more childlike than other mammals and tend to want to explore, whether it be physically or mentally.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-medina/" >The Plague in Egypt</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Introduction The Egyptian Gazette delves into detail about the plague and its various forms. The cattle and bubonic plague both created epidemics in Egypt especially from 1905 through 1907. The spread of the bubonic plague swept through Egypt during the early 1900s. Regions across the nation including districts of farms, small towns, hubs, and port cities were all infected by the mass illness. The epidemic did not only hurt the well-being of residents of Egypt, but it resulted in a change in agriculture, markets, the economy, and the habits of everyday life for the residents of Egypt.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-castro/" >Theatre</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          According to the Calendar of Coming Events, Alexandria had many events listed and lined up from Monday to Saturday. Typically, these events consist of many different activities including people going to the theatre, listening to the orchestra, or dressing up to attend glamorous galas. I noticed that in the Coming of Events Calendar there were many reoccurring theatre names. I decided to research the different types, and the most reoccurring theatres in Alexandria between 1905-1907.

      <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-ell/" >Wedding and Funeral Flowers</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          I wanted to see similarities between funerals and the type of arrangements mentioned in the articles. I took notice of the date these weddings were happening, and if orange blossoms were used. I did research that showed during the 1900s orange blossoms and myrtle flowers were very popular in royal weddings.
Topic Looking through issues of the Egyptian Gazette, I found many features about weddings and funerals. I was interested to see if trends were popular during certain seasons during 1905 and 1906.

          My research topic is communication and travel in Alexandria/ Cairo, through means of Telegraphs.
Method //div//head[contains(.,&quot;EASTERN TELEGRAPH CO. LTD.&quot;)]//following-sibling::table[contains(.,&quot;FROM&quot;)]//following-sibling::cell[1]//string()
The Code was used to acquire the information analyzed and assessed in the paper. It reads every cell after the first cell of a table containing “FROM,” within a headline that contains “EASTERN TELEGRAPH CO. LTD.” Inside of each division of all the pages of every file inside of the content folder of the repository from the course website.
