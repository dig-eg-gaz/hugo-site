    <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-douglas/">Insurance vs Assurance</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      After completing my Bachelors in Spanish and Commercial Entrepreneurship, I plan on earning my Masters in Health Administration and hopefully opening up my own health insurance company. Therefore, when I noticed the many ads for different insurance companies in the Egyptian Gazette newspaper, it sparked a topic for me to put my concentration toward, learn more about, and do my analysis project on.
WHAT IS INSURANCE vs WHAT IS ASSURANCE ”Insurance is an agreement in which and individual pays a company to protect him/her from possible loss or damage, can be a property loss or financial loss.

    <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-monaco/">Maximum Heat of the Sun in Different Stations Across Alexandria [May 1906-April 1907]</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      INTRODUCTION The overall goal of this individual analysis project is to analyze a range of maximum temperatures from data taken from different stations in Alexandria, Egypt. I chose to investigate the timeline of May 1906 to April 1907 with the hopes of finding whether or not there are correlations between the temperature of each location themselves. In combination to this, I also will make inferences between why some stations are higher than others and how that can relate to how busy they are.

    <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-medicine/">Medicine Analysis Project</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Many diseases that emerged in the 19th century included cholera, yellow fever, typhus, smallpox, and many more. However, it wasn’t until the late 19th century that weak medical practices became outdated. Before these breakthroughs there was only a basic understanding, which furthermore, commercialized the industry by selling medications with little to know regulation utilizing public fear and desperation. Many campaigns and ads sold the idea of “bad blood” being the cause as these medications were claimed to generate new blood and purify the body.

    <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-sports/">What Brings in the Crowds for Sporting Events?</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Throughout history, sports have impacted the lives of not only the participants, but also the fans who choose to watch them. As the sports group, we decided to focus our analysis project on the different factors which can affect spectator turnout across the major sports of the Egyptian Gazette. Among residents of early 1900’s Egypt, three of the most popular sports were football (soccer), polo, and horse racing. By looking into the data that we have collected for these sports, we are able to get an idea of what Egyptian sport fans wanted to see.

    <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-naranjo/">Bubonic Plague</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The goal of my post is to answer questions such as the reasons behind the spread of the Bubonic Plague across Egypt, what cities were the most affected and why, and what actions were taken to cease it. In doing so I will integrate charts and graphs of where and when occurrences were the most often. This information was gathered conducting an Xpath query on the Egyptian Gazette between the years 1904-1907.

    <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-dorsey/">Diseases and the Medical Schools/Hospitals History</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The goal of my analysis project was to discover where medical schools were located within Egypt and what diseases where occurring near these schools. I then wanted to know if the occurrences of these disease in correlation with a certain school of medicine, would mean that the disease was an epidemic for that region. I wanted to know this because if the disease was found to be researched in these medical schools and hospitals In the Egyptian Gazette the term medical school is not common but the term school of medicine is.

    <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-grimaldo/">Mosquitoes in the Egyptian Gazette</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      For the analysis project, my group focused primarily on the environment in Egypt, and the various aspects of the environment. For my individual analysis, I’ve decided to focus on the mosquitoes in the environment in Egypt. I was curious as to how mosquitoes tied into the environment, more specifically if they were prevalent in the environment, what time of year mosquitoes seemed to come around and interfere with the daily lives of the individuals living in Egypt, and how they affected individuals and business in Egypt.

    <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-bryant/">The Cotton Worm in Egypt from 1905 to 1907</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Cotton has been an essential export from the Egyptian economy for centuries, sometimes being referred to as the country’s “white gold”. In the beginning of the twentieth century, there was a cotton worm epidemic that greatly threatened the cotton plants across all the Egyptian provinces. The Khedive made a national decree that informed the public of the cotton worm menace, and contained a call to action for citizens to band together to combat the cotton worm.

    <h2><a href="/post/19-analysis-hayes/">Billiards Participants</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      This paper will examine the various types of individuals who go to and participate in billiards events. The specific topics was sparked by a query into the sport. Initially, the query resulted with only ten results, which was quite a large comparison to the other individuals in my group who resulted in hundreds, if not thousands of results when querying soccer or horse racing. The low number of results encouraged me to really delve into the few amount of results to figure out the reason for such a low number.
