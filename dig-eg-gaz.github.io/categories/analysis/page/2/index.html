    <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-brown/">Jobs in Cheap Prepaid Advertisements</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      For my analysis project, I decided to analyze job advertisements in the “Cheap Prepaid Advertisements” section of the Egyptian Gazette. The specific contents of the job advertisements that I analyzed were the languages that employers wanted applicants to know, the expected gender of the applicants, and the adjectives used to describe desired applicants. In addition, I considered the amount of job advertisements that were present in different months during 1905 and 1906 to see if there were any noticeable trends.

    <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-majonica/">Letters to the Editor 1906</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Immediately upon first glance of the Monday issue of my week in “The Egyptian Gazette,” I was intrigued by the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section. As a history major, I am constantly learning about different time periods and cultures, while desperately trying to grasp the true interests of the people living in these different time periods and cultures. So, when I saw the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section, I imagined the potential for greater understanding of what people were interested in Egypt during the early 20th century.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-bridges/">Local and General Analysis</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      There were many topics to chose from pertaining to the Egyptian Gazette however, in my analysis project I decided to look at the &ldquo;Local and General&rdquo; section of the newspaper. I was interested in the topics that showed up most in the section and moreover what topics kept getting printed in the issues of the newspaper. I wanted to know throughout the newspaper what topics were, not so much being read more than the other but, reoccurring actions to be talked or read about in Egypt during the time.

  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-pregasen/">Lord Cromer in the &#39;Egyptian Gazette&#39;</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      For my research analysis project, I looked at the number of times Lord Cromer was mentioned throughout the Egyptian Gazette. I first searched a simple XPath query by searching for the word &ldquo;Cromer&rdquo; with the restriction of //div[not(@feature=“advert”)] to look throughout all the issues and every div except the divs with the feature of advert. I looked through the entire content repository. I found each issue that Lord Cromer had been mentioned at and put that data into the text editor, Atom.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-frady/">Marriage, Weddings and Divorce</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      My inspiration for this Analysis project began with my blog post. When looking through my page images for the Egyptian Gazette, I came across something that really peaked my interest, “A Prison Wedding”. This directed my attention towards unions during the times the newspapers were published. I was curious to discover trends in marriage during this time-period to divulge whether prison marriage was a societal norm. It’s not every day in today’s society that I hear of a convict being married in secret to a prison guard’s daughter, and accusingly by the prison guard nonetheless!

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-mason/">Most Popular Sports</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I chose to study the most popular sports in Egypt during the early 1900s for my analysis project. As a Sports Management major, this subject is very interesting to me as I can compare how sports culture has evolved and changed throughout the years. Newspaper sections titled &ldquo;Sport and Play&rdquo; frequently appear throughout the issues of the Egyptian Gazette, and many popular sports and sports clubs appear throughout the years.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-bolger/">Polo in Cairo</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I chose to do my Analysis Project on the performances of different polo players and teams in Egypt and using different xpath queries and analysis to see who is the best polo player and the best polo team in Egypt. For this analysis, I will be searching through the editions of the 1905-1907 Egyptian Gazette and determine which of the polo players and teams in Egypt have the better performances through those years.

    <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-degroat/">Rainfall</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Microhistory gives the ability to focus on smaller details in history to be able to fully understand why and what happened during that day in time. Microhistory for this class allowed the students to investigate the Egyptian Gazette newspaper from 1905, 1906, and 1907 and see details from our certain weeks assigned to us. The week that was given to me was the week of June 17th, 1907. After analyzing six days of this newspaper, we start to see similarities and patterns in the paper overtime.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-cannon/">Reported Accidents, Incidents, Tragedies, and Disasters</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      When we think of the day to day lives of people we may think of a consistent schedule that only changes when major events happen. However, from first hand experience I know the largest disruption to daily life are accidents. So when looking at the lives of people living halfway across the world over a hundred years ago I wanted to see how they handled these accidents and in what ways they were affected by them.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/18-analysis-donofrio/">Robberies in Alexandria</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Theft should be considered one of the most selfish crimes, as it is literally the act of stealing from others in order to benefit from their belongings. Whether it is out of desperation, or simply for the rush of adrenaline, robbery should not be a crime that is as common as it is today. However, robbery has not only been an issue recently; as shown in multiple issues of The Egyptian Gazette from 1905 to 1906.
