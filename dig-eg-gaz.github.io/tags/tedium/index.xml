      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t say that around fifty hours of work in Oxygen was what I expected when I signed up for this class, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly what I&amp;rsquo;ve been given. Work in Oxygen can be rewarding, tedious, and frustrating in one package, usually at the same time. While I have sympathies for my classmates who saw massive technical issues, I never
had anything that problematic when I was XML-izing my files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult part of this class was largely typing most of my week by hand. FineReader&amp;rsquo;s trial ran out on my desktop, and when I tried to download it on my Mac, I found that it didn&amp;rsquo;t work anywhere near as well as it did on my desktop. So I would up typing the entirety of my week under my own manpower, rather than relying on AABBY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, it was a fairly methodical, sensible process. There were instances of annoyance, like when I would accidentally delete a div and the entire thing would collapse, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that part&amp;rsquo;s past me now. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to going more in-depth into the Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;
