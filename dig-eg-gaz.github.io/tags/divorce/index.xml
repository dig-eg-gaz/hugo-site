      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to write my blog post about an interesting article I found on the first day of my assigned week. This article was about how an older wealthy lady named Waghida Hanem seemed to have had her feelings captured by a young man, whom her family believed was only after her substantial finances. The young man successfully convinced Ms. Waghida to leave for Zagazig to meet and marry him along with jewels and money valuing around 20,000 pounds. At the news of the marriage the family of the bride demanded the revocation of the marriage and subsequent divorce of the bride and groom which was granted through the correct legal proceedings. Ms. Waghida was left in the care of her brother which she refused and took refuge with her lawyer however she has now disappeared without a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article was interesting to me for a number of reasons. One being that you don&amp;rsquo;t hear many cases today of young men trying to get with older women for their money, most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s the other way around with young women trying to find that rich lonely man to latch onto. Another thing I found interesting was how the family was able to literally nullify the marriage without the consent of either the bride or the groom and the fact that it was completely legal. There has been ongoing debate and trials regarding ways to legally nullify marriages in the U.S as outlined 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;amp;sid=ed4cddda-385a-463f-9405-36c8c02418ee%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
, though I know of no way in America for someone who has no part in the marriage to nullify it against the bride and groom&amp;rsquo;s wishes so the fact that this was allowed amazes me. However 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;amp;sid=ed4cddda-385a-463f-9405-36c8c02418ee%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
 it is shown how in India a marriage may be nullified for a variety of reasons including if either the bride or groom was declared mentally unsound. This could be attributed to the laws in India that require a woman to have a male guardian so they are seen as less than women are seen in America. I read an article 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-high-court-hindu-muslim-islamic-state-979157-2017-05-25&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
 on how a marriage was made null and void by a court in India over the fact that it was believed the daughter was forcibly converted to Islam. Apparently this isn&amp;rsquo;t extremely uncommon for countries other than the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough I found a blog post 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-pustam/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
 where the author decided to write an article about the fact that marriages were seen as a way for women to be happy and the author seemed extremely upset with that belief. I found it ironic considering Mrs. Waghida&amp;rsquo;s family forcibly put an end to her marriage even though she inferably was happy. You could say that her family was trying to prevent her from getting her heart broken by this swindler or just hurt in general because as outlined 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-donofrio/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
 where a man attempting to fix his relationship with his wife ends up stabbing her out of anger, domestic violence was not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Marriage &amp; Divorce</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my blog post, I chose to talk about the topic of Marriage &amp;amp; Divorce in the year of 1907, around the month August. I was particularly intrigued by the emphasis on marriage being placed in the Egyptian Gazette newspaper which is opposed to what we see in these modern times. One specific section in my reading that gathered my interest was titled &amp;ldquo;Alexandria Merchant Divorce&amp;rdquo; published on August 6, 1907.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief overview about the story resulted in the end of a marriage between Mr. William Getty, a cotton merchant of Alexandria and his wife. Over the past years, she strayed away and disappeared from him, leaving him to wonder about her whereabouts and how she was doing. While on her death bed, she had an incurable diseases that she couldn&amp;rsquo;t be healed from. She wrote a letter to her husband confessing that she was unfaithful to him throughout the duration of their marriage. In defense of her statement, she felt that the money she had leftover should be given to him since she recently became a Christian Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excerpt from the passage was quite interesting for me to read because I was fascinated with the explicit details provided and how it was shared with all of the world to see. Although they didn&amp;rsquo;t share a response from her husband after he received the message from her, I would have wondered what his thoughts, response or even last words to her would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reference to this article, I found another interesting topic from the &amp;ldquo;Egyptian Gazette&amp;rdquo; in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/cooper-wife-murder/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;another blog post&lt;/a&gt;
 about a crazy man killing his wife with an unusual weapon. Although there is no reason for his crazy acts, he committed the crime from speculations that his wife was cheating on him. The magnitude of this article was extremely huge enough to reach the newspaper because people thought the city should be aware of this person and who he is. This article correlated to mine because there was suspicion of cheating in both marriages where the results ended up tragic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Domestic Tragedy</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-donofrio/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article tells the story of a divorced couple that ultimately ended in fatality. In attempts to fix his relationship, the spouse tried to convince his former wife to get back together. However, when she refused, he got angry and stabbed her multiple times. After this violent and impulsive reaction had subsided, the man realized what he had done, and thinking he had killed his spouse, he drew a revolver and shot himself dead. However, the woman simply fell unconscious and did not die.
This story has a theme similar to Shakespeareâ€™s &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt; pertaining to the story of a spouse thinking his partner is dead and consequentially killing himself because of that thought. It also shows that people would do anything for love, and that people act irrationally when they are put in desperate situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, domestic violence was not uncommon, as shown in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/cooper-wife-murder/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Matthew Cooper&amp;rsquo;s blog post&lt;/a&gt;
. Here Cooper talks about an article on a man who killed his wife with an blow to the head by a bar of iron. Although the context is different between the two instances, it is clear that abuse within marriages was not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
