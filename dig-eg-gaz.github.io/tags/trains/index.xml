      <title>Cairo Visitor Gravely Injured</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the blog post I chose an article titled “Cairo Visitor Gravely Injured” from page 3 of the Thursday December 13 1906 issue. The article talks about an accident that occurred on the P. and O. express in France the Friday before where two passengers were injured, and I believe one of them died? It&amp;rsquo;s not very clear and is not actually stated, but is implied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two passengers injured were Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hanna, who were visiting from Dublin. Mrs. Hanna was not seriously injured but it seems that Mr. Hanna was killed. The suspected death was caused by a piece of metal that crashed through the window. Apparently, they’re not sure how it really happened, either from a bridge or a part of the train which doesn’t really make sense because I would think if it came from the bridge it would cause more external damage versus internal like the part of the train would cause making it easier to pinpoint the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me to question just how in-depth incidents were investigated at this time. Did they just quickly glance at the scene and decide on the circumstances surrounding it, or did they thoroughly investigate and try to find the actual cause. Interestingly enough there is a similar article that was found in &lt;em&gt;The London Times&lt;/em&gt; that follows up on the accident and says that Mr. Hanna was severely injured in the accident and died the next morning at the hospital. It gives a little bit more information about him saying he was 42 years old and was an engineer on an Indian Railway. It also says how his wife Mrs. Hannas condition has improved. While there isn&amp;rsquo;t a happy ending, at least we are able to find a little bit more information on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Train on Fire</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the issue of Monday, October 22, 1906 in the Egyptian Gazette there was a short article on page three written about an express train, heading from Luxor to Cairo, that caught on fire due to an exploding lamp in one of the first-class cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article gathered my attention for several reasons, the first of which being the words fire and exploding lamp. The only other blog post with an explosion was larger scale, but it was done on purpose. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/Chatham-Explosion/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Read more about this military-style explosion&lt;/a&gt;
. Lamps actually exploded fairly often in 1906 because electricity was fairly new and the light bulbs must not have been built properly. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thespruce.com/light-bulb-failure-and-heres-why-1152457&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Read more about the quality of light bulbs in the early 1900s&lt;/a&gt;
. Apparently to deal with this burning train car, the best plan of attack was to detach it from the rest of the train and send villagers to put out the fire, which makes sense so as to not allow the fire to spread all around the train, but what about the people inside the car that was on fire?? This brings me to my last point of curiosity, which is certain members of the crew that helped put out the fire. According to the paper “Three Italians distinguished themselves by the coolness and the effectiveness with which they worked.” This just proves that Italians must’ve been cool all throughout history and still are to this day because I’m just imagining three big guys with slicked back hair in suits named Tony communicating wonderfully with each other and the other villagers to put out this train fire. This brings to mind a different blog post about close knit communities in Egypt, because the community of Kift must&amp;rsquo;ve been close with one another to put out this random train fire.

. The article concludes with the fact that there were no injuries in this fire, which is pretty miraculous considering the assumed lack of experience among the villagers who worked to put out the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, flaming trains are not a thing of the past in Egypt. In the early 2000s a train caught fire due to an illegal use of a gas stove. The passengers of this train weren&amp;rsquo;t so lucky as there were at least 373 confirmed deaths.
