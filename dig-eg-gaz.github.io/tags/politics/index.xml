      <description>&lt;p&gt;People make careless remarks all the time, especially public figures who then regret what they said. Egyptian royalty in 1906 was no different. The Wednesday, January 31st issue devotes an entire column to the Princess Nazli to allow her to make a statement refuting a comment she had made the previous Saturday. This comment consisted of her saying Egyptians were babies and Lord Cromer &amp;ldquo;did everything.&amp;rdquo; The editor of &lt;em&gt;Al Mokattam&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Nimr, jumped on this statement and asked the princess if she had adopted the French nationality instead. Princess Nazli then defends herself with the response that she has no desire to change her nationality, but still defends her words. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.revolvy.com/topic/Princess%20Nazli%20Fazl&amp;amp;item_type=topic&#34;&gt;She was a very educated woman, which was uncharacteristic of that society, who had good experience with other cultures&lt;/a&gt;, so she knew how to defend herself. She claims that the translation in the newspaper was correct and stands by what she says, praising Lord Cromer. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.egy.com/historica/queennazli.php&#34;&gt;Princess Nazli had a very involved family, many of whom were of different nationalities&lt;/a&gt;. Although she spends the beginning of her statement defending herself as an Ottoman subject, she seems to spend a lot of time talking about Lord Cromer and her father&#39;s influence, seemingly as a distracting tactic to get off topic. Toward the end of her statement, she revisits the original issue: what she claims as her nationality. Princess Nazli almost seems to attack her critics, asking a series of questions regarding why her nationality was being challenged. The politicians of today use all these same tactics. They make it seem like they address a question while really discussing something else, then turn the conversation around to make themselves look better. I find it fascinating that this trend has persisted throughout so many decades, possibly even multiple centuries. For me, it begs the question: Will politics ever be honest?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Death in Egypt and in my Mind.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who would have ever of thought, that the utmost important news in Alexandra, in the year 1906, would be the deaths of a native woman and her daughter, and the director of a local hospital. This rather sad news is printed on page 3 of the Monday issue of my week in the Egyptian Gazette.  Not only is the content random, but this page has put a tremendous cramp in my style. It has become the pinnacle of my failure thus far. I do not find it a coincidence that the only page in my issue that is literally printed crookedly, contains the contents of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page has sparked the actual death of my patience, and my social life.  It is the exact reason why I lose sleep at night, and I cannot complete my Monday issue. At this point, I feel that my rant has become some kind of a nuisance, so with that being said, lets get to the subject matter at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mother and daughter were found asphyxiated in their room due to a charcoal fire. It is not mentioned in the paper, but the most obvious cause of death is carbon monoxide poisoning. Were Egyptians at the time not aware of the effects of carbon monoxide on the body? It makes me wonder what level of education the citizens of Alexandra actual possessed. Hell, they make me feel like a genius. In other news, the director of the Greek Hospital at Alexandra, Mr. Stiliano, died of heart disease. In the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, they do not specify what kind of heart disease, which makes me question the educational levels, once again, of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; employees. These two cases of death can properly represent my mind-state at the moment, confused, intrigued, disappointed, yet self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;
