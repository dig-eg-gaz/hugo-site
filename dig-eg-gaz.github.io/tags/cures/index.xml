      <title>Pink Pills: Stronger Than Death</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-12-16-phuong/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pills and medicines have relentlessly shown themselves throughout the Egyptian Gazette as miraculous solutions to peoples&amp;rsquo; problems. This piece called &amp;ldquo;STRONGER THAN DEATH&amp;rdquo; begins with stating its purpose: to add more evidence that Pink Pills work. The story of a woman&#39;s tragedy plays out in which she develops accumulating sickness after having many children in a short span of time. The sickness only worsens as she finds out her husband had died falling, trying to get out of a tram car in America. The story goes on with how she healed to the point of full health after discovering the existence of the pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this article seems to be more about promoting an idea than a real cure. What offsets its validity as a medicine is the idea that it could cure numerous types of sicknesses. &amp;ldquo;They cure anaemia, chlorosis, general debility, stom-ach complaints, rheumatism and neurasthenia.&amp;rdquo; Targeting the population, it uses several tactics. The article appeals to the entire audience, saying &amp;ldquo;Everyone must agree&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;they will do for everybody&amp;rdquo; and more. The article uses a relatable and pained main character that the people would feel sorry for, appealing to human emotions when the descriptions of her life and tragedies such as her husband dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;From this instance one learns what Pink Pills can achieve for the weak and enfeebled.&amp;rdquo; This statement paints the pill as a wondrous cure that saves people from weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found was that these stories of the use of phenomenal Pink Pills may be continuous and confirm their worth. In this &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-wallace/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that the pill has before already been called &amp;ldquo;Pink Pills are said to cure Anaemia, Indigestion, Eczema, Rheumatism, Sciatica, St. Vitus’ Dance, Neuralgia, Nervous Disorders, Paralysis, and Locomotor Ataxy.&amp;rdquo; This article &amp;ldquo;STRONGER THAN DEATH&amp;rdquo; links back to that with the mention of some of those same sicknesses. The author gives more depth to the pill&#39;s contents and how the pills are a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nature&#39;s Skin Food</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-castro/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my Tuesday issue, I found an interesting home remedy for acne and other skin problems. It appears this is something distinct and special to Alexandria. As I was adding the advertisement for page 2 of the October 1906 issue. As a person that loves to learn about skin care and is addicted to by skin care products, this advertisement stood out to me. According to the advertisement, the cream derives from Icilma Natural Water, but most have named it Nature&#39;s Skin Food. From the Icilma Natural water a cream is produced called the Icilma Flour Cream. It is described as the being a no grease or oil cream which I find amazing because most skin care products are filled with oil that, as a result, often causes the skin to produce more oil. This is especially helpful to people that have oily skin which leads them to have problematic skin. The advertisement states that it cleanses the pores of the skin and make it pearly white. I think the Icilma Flour Cream could possibly have been the modern invention of acne remedies in Alexandria during the 1900s. The Icilma Flour Cream sounds like the Neutrogena or Proactive most people preferred to use for their skin problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddg.12947&#34;&gt;Back to the Roots: Dermatology in Ancient Egyptian Medicine&lt;/a&gt; in the 2016 Journal of the German Society of Dermatology, Egyptian medicine and the treatment of acute and chronic wounds and injuries such as cosmetic procedures took an important role. Additionally, it seems that another student, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/nunez-blogpost/&#34;&gt;Sabrina Nunez&lt;/a&gt;, also took a curious look into the Iclimia medicine and discovered that Stephen Armitage founded Iclima in 1989. Yet, it seems that herbal medicine was the best option remedy for the Egyptians seeming as the technology was not very advanced, according to the 2015 review journal &lt;a href=&#34;https://doaj.org/article/602aea8253f84a068559bb763708c006?&#34;&gt;Ancient Egyptian Medicine: A Systematic Review&lt;/a&gt;. However, there were instances of &amp;ldquo;miracle&amp;rdquo; cures and medicine like Doan&#39;s Backache Kidney Pills, as reported by previous student &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/Esteve-Medicine/&#34;&gt;Justin Esteve&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, the medicine used in Egypt was produced in different ways and counter products such as in mineral-based compounds, set milk, honey using tropical, oral methods, according to an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27594551&#34;&gt;Treatment Adherence and Beliefs about Medicines among Egyptian Vitiligo Patients&lt;/a&gt; published in Dermatologic Theraphy Journal in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pink Pills for Pale People</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-wallace/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the age of clickbait, tabloid papers, and fake news, it&#39;s still nice to see that we haven&#39;t changed a bit. This is a classic example of a snake oil salesmen at work. Dr. Williams&amp;rsquo; Pink Pills are said to cure Anaemia, Indigestion, Eczema, Rheumatism, Sciatica, St. Vitus’ Dance, Neuralgia, Nervous Disorders, Paralysis, and Locomotor Ataxy. Since the pills did have ferrous sulphate or just Iron sulphate, it would have an effect on the anemic. This however, is still a scam because the amount that was in his pink pills was much less than actual medicine and because of this, the pills were much weaker and were more expensive than just the regular iron pills doctors would usually prescribe. This is probably one of the only pills that are in song, while the song is a critique of commercialism in society, it was sung by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu2V3TkHufA&#34;&gt;Benny Bell&lt;/a&gt;. Also something that intrigued me was that you can still &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.springbokpharmacy.co.za/Product?product_id=354130&amp;amp;category_id=33098&#34;&gt;buy these pills&lt;/a&gt; online to cure basically anything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more &lt;a href=&#34;https://diseasesofmodernlife.org/2016/11/29/pills-for-our-ills-dr-williams-pink-pills-for-pale-people/&#34;&gt;elaborate backstory&lt;/a&gt; of the company and pills, as well as how they fared in Asian markets.
[Pink Pills](1907-05-20-p5 selection)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend of snake oil pills being sold in The Egyptian Gazette is not a new one. Looking through other blog posts I saw a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/Esteve-Medicine/&#34;&gt;listing&lt;/a&gt; about &amp;ldquo;Doan&#39;s Backache Kidney Pills&amp;rdquo;. The man who used it was told he only had 3 months to live but after some pills, he made a miraculous recovery! Another post follows the same vein of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/baxter-Peruna/&#34;&gt;miraculous medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Miraculous Medicine</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-03-06-baxter-peruna/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Ida Caldwell, a seemingly sweet old lady, has been suffering with “catarrh of the respiratory organs on and off for the last three years”. She had to use her greatest care not to “expose herself to chilly air or dampness as it increased her troubles.” She was advised to change her climate, but she couldn’t leave her family so she had to stay put. Then she was introduced to Peruna which relieved her of her pain in three days, and she was completely cured in two months. What a miracle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post seemed like a serious article about a well-known woman who seemed to be in a lot of pain due to her &amp;ldquo;catarrh of her lungs.&amp;rdquo; However, when I kept reading, I noticed that it was just a gimmicky ad for a sketchy medicine that claimed to &amp;ldquo;cure symptoms of the common cold.&amp;rdquo; The ad seemed really convincing, and I almost believed that this woman had her illness cured because of this medicine. On the downside, I did notice that this ad sounded a lot like the ones I hear today, which seems quite interesting, that advertisements haven’t changed that much since 1906. This was a very interesting, well put together ad, and I do believe that a lot of people would have jumped at the chance to buy this medicine upon reading this article.&lt;/p&gt;
