      <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 18th, 1907, Tuesday&#39;s issue of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was released to the public. In this issue of the newspaper, on the fourth page, under the section labeled &amp;ldquo;Letter to the Editor,&amp;rdquo; a person wrote to the editor about his / her referring to Canis Major&#39;s recent letter. The letter written by Canis Major is posted in the newspaper above the Letter to the Editor – Police Dog Service. Canis Major’s letter discussed the treatment of dogs when getting closer to death. Major stated that “[he] thinks that the matter should be looked into, and something should be done, to make the life of [the] dogs, during the time they wait for death, less painful for them.” In response to Canis Major’s letter, a “Lover of Animals” commented how a friend of theirs dog suffered from a disease “contracted in the black hole of Boulac.” The animal suffered through death, and the person who responded to Canis Major’s letter wanted to make a statement agreeing with him, that dogs should be treated better in their last days and minutes. Having this section, “Letters to the Editor,” allows the public to develop their thoughts and issues about society to the newspaper. This gives them a chance to speak up. Even though, the newspaper most likely cannot put in submissions that will cause a riot, they still put in some that have a small amount of concern from the people which keeps everything well balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing another search about dogs, not animals, there were only a few articles that came up about the cruelty in their treatment. While there are other blog posts about different animals and dogs, I saw no record of any with an emphasis on the treatment of dogs during their dying stages. Regarding the SPCA, I ran multiple xpath query’s and all were returned with no results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dead Man, One Horse</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Murders overall aren’t that common, so it was even more surprising when I found out that there was a murderous horse on the loose! On July 7, 1906, it was reported that a man sneaked into the yard of a resident. Even though his intentions were never discovered it is assumed by the article that his sole goal was to steal a horse. When in the process of untying the ropes of the animal, the horse kicked him square in the face, killing him instantly. This is one thief that never got a second chance. It makes me wonder if there are any other murderous animals in Alexandria, other than the everyday man. If it wasn’t for the horse killing him I believe the owner would have killed him if caught. I came to this conclusion after reading many articles having to do with thieves and criminals. Even if it wasn’t the owner the police would have surely caught him because according to the newspaper they have an excellent arrest rate. Yet the fate of this poor man was surely set the minute he decided to trespass on someone’s property. Upon reading this I am almost certain that thieves all over the city were either scared of stealing any more horses, or that they were just more careful when stealing.&lt;/p&gt;
