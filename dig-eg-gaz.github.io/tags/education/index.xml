&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-shift-in-education-in-egypt&#34;&gt;The Shift in Education in Egypt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to research the word “education” from the whole contents of previous issues. In the history of the education in Egypt, I learned that just as I thought, schools were only for boys (1905-09-26), and all thy learned was the basics of their religion until they finished and took the trade or possession of their father. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3443092?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across and was impressed to see the small bits that came up. While I was expecting there to be education mainly for men or higher public figures, but actually found that education is important to the people of this time in this area, and education for orphans, children of the lower classes, and even young boys (making more elementary schools)(1905-04-14). There are even scholarships being offered, as seen in 1905-05-06, and there is desire to keep improving the educational standards of years to come, and desires to make use of the educational facilities such as the &amp;ldquo;Museum,&amp;rdquo; one of the most famous schools in Alexandria (1905-04-12). &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/patrology/schoolofalex/I-Intro/chapter1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1905-01-12, it is stated that Medicine, Law, and more liberal studies were professions that people strived to improve in. In it is celebrated that parents are allowing their daughters to receive primary education (1905-06-06 and 1905-07-12), and it is said that men who are educated want wives who are educated, too (1905-12-20). This time period seems to be the time for advancements in education in which fund are being put out to make educational buildings, everyone is beginning to get an education, and education is valued. At this time in Egypt, education has made tremendous improvements like an increase in the literacy rate and by a drop in the number of kids outside of school, but still faces some challenges such as the size of school not being able to accommodate the amount of children in Egypt and social issues arise in schools that get in thee way of the higher education of students. &lt;a href=&#34;https://wenr.wes.org/2019/02/education-in-egypt-2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within every issue throughout my week I continually saw two advertisements that stood out to me, an advertisement for a school of Language and an advertisement for an &amp;ldquo;English School&amp;rdquo;. Seeing education opportunities from the early 1900s is fascinating to me as it is during the century that public education became a cornerstone in developed nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First are the Berlitz Schools of Languages, typically found under the &amp;ldquo;Cheap Pre-paid advertisement&amp;rdquo; column on Page 5&amp;rsquo;s. It sounded familiar to me, and after doing a brief amount of searching, this is a education company/institution that has persisted since 1878 all the way until to the present day, hailing from the state of Rhode Island. In 1905 however, students in Egypt would only be able to attend the locations present in Alexandria and Cairo, unlike now, as the Berlitz Corporation offers full courses online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next advert regarding education that intrigued me was the &amp;ldquo;English School, Nicosia&amp;rdquo; advertisement. Offering a range of subjects, from Turkish to Mathematics, this school seemed a little more similar to institutions of the modern day. Also, this school seemed to have a sessions of Cricket and Football to be played with the instructors, which struck me as something related to more modern school systems. After a small amount of searching, it appears that this school persisted to the modern day just as the Berlitz program did. Besides being one of the more &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.englishschool.ac.cy/schools-history&#34; title=&#34;Nicosia English School Official History Page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;notable institutions of higher learning&lt;/a&gt; in the Middle East, it is also an modern example of social change. For over two decades following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Turkish invasion of Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, Turkish students were not admitted into the school, becoming a predominantly Greek Cypriot institution. However in 2003, the English School opened it&amp;rsquo;s admission to Turkish Cypriots and it&amp;rsquo;s general admission numbers have only grown exponentially since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Nicosia_school.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image name&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though during this time secondary education wasn&amp;rsquo;t seen as something that the whole of society deserved, it is still worth looking into these smaller institutions because it gives people a clearer understanding of how a system of education grows as more people become involved in it, and the social changes that occur through a better educated populace.&lt;/p&gt;
