      <title>6,000 Birds Found Dead</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across a morbidly funny article when reading through my week of the Egyptian Gazette. The title, &amp;ldquo;FATE OF 6,000 BIRDS&amp;rdquo; and to summarize the article briefly, after two nights of thick fog, nearly 6,000 birds were found dead under a lighthouse. They were attracted to the light in the fog and flew right against it. (The full article can be found in Page 4 of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.rawgit.com/dig-eg-gaz/content/master/1905-12-18.xml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Monday, December 18, 1905&lt;/a&gt; issue of the Egyptian Gazette.) Not much else is mentioned in the article, it is a rather brief memorial. This struck me as being a unique article so I decided to share it. I did a quick search on the location of the lighthouse, &amp;ldquo;Cape Grisnez&amp;rdquo; and turns out this story takes place in France! Cape Grisnez is in northern France between Wissant and Audresselles. The cape held place to a naval battle during the Napoleonic Wars in 1805, and also would play a historical role in World War II. The lighthouse was built in 1837, originally standing 46 feet tall. In 1861, the lighthouse was raised to 79 feet tall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading articles from the past makes the research more interesting, you read it from the perspective of the time frame it was written, but when investigating further you get a full picture that spans past the newspaper and through to present day. It just struck me funny how such a odd story could make international news, though granted the Egyptian
Gazette was sold to an audience of mainly Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;
