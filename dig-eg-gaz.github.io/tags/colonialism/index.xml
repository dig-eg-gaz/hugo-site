      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the telegraphs, a man by the name of Matteo Moral, a known Anarchist, attempted to assassinate King Alfonso of Spain with a bomb. After being confronted by a police officer, Moral killed the officer. Shortly after, to evade capture, he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart. Alongside Moral, an English tourist named Hamilton was also arrested under the charges of being an anarchist. The article does not state any more details about Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s arrest other than the Spanish authority refused to release him to the British.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that the assassination attempt happened in Spain but it is being reported on by the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; in British Egypt. Why is anarchist activity important to the British? Before communism was the boogeyman of Europe, anarchism seemed to be the ideology that was branded the enemy of the state. A year prior to this assassination attempt, the Russian state was under threat of &amp;ldquo;anarchy&amp;rdquo; during the Russo-Japanese War. That was also reported by the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; in an article called &amp;ldquo;IS IT PEACE&amp;rdquo; which can be located in the June 1, 1906 edition on page two. Anarchism was an ideology that threatened the state was a whole. In an age where the state extended its power through colonial empires, anarchism threatened to dismantle the colonial system by weakening the state. To Great Britain, tracking anarchist activities of competing empires is important because it is a way to evaluate how strong the enemy central state is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more general information and history on anarchism as an ideology, feel free to read Noam Chomsky&amp;rsquo;s article, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://inthesetimes.com/article/16081/a_history_of_anarchism/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A Brief History of Anarchism&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fashoda Incident</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-10-10-fashoda-incident/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-10-10-fashoda-incident/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This small newspaper section addresses the infamous &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.britannica.com/event/Fashoda-Incident&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fashoda Incident&lt;/a&gt; that occurred between Britain and France during a period of intense colonialism in Africa. It shares that the ex-Prime Minister of France, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Louis-de-Saulces-de-Freycinet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;M. de Freycinet&lt;/a&gt;, is writing a book that promotes peace and cooperation between France and Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case he presents in &lt;a href=&#34;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b749498;view=2up;seq=460&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt; says that England was in the right during the Fashoda Incident but could have easily handled the situation better than they did. He also refutes the claims of the French courts, who said that the French response was a mistake. Put simply, he is about to publish a work that will try to put to rest misconceptions about the event that have been circulating through the public in an attempt to resolve any bad feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is amazing to see this event described in an everyday context and even more fascinating that an ex-Prime Minister of France would declare England to be in the right, despite the competitive nature of colonial affairs. This entry is not only informational, but it also acts as an advertisement of sorts, presenting the name, author and content of a soon to be released book to the public eye. The information and arguments shared through the book may have strengthened Franco-British relations and helped lead to where the two powers stood during World War I.&lt;/p&gt;
